===============

My master thesis _A Process Calculus for Parallel and Distributed Programming in Haskell_.

__Please note__: This README.md is rather informal and has been added __after__ submitting the thesis, it is __not__ part of the thesis and just here to give a brief overview.

# Abstract
Parallel and distributed programming usually aim at speeding up a program, but introduce a rather large amount of boilerplate code. This boilerplate code can be avoided by moving to a higher level of abstraction. 


# Getting the Document
The repository contains a Makefile for compiling the document, simply use
```
make
```
You will need to have __pdflatex__, __bibtex__ and __makeindex__ installed for this.

Alternatively you can obtain the document from [here](https://github.com/chrisbloecker/master-thesis/releases/download/v1.0/Master.Thesis.Christopher.Blocker.pdf).
